## [v1.3.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added

#### Description Tagger — Structured Category Prompting
- **Structured category checklist** in the system prompt forces the LLM to cover every visual dimension: `[PARTICIPANTS]` `[HAIR]` `[EYES]` `[CLOTHING]` `[ACCESSORIES]` `[BODY]` `[POSE]` `[EXPRESSION]` `[SETTING]` `[LIGHTING]` `[ATMOSPHERE]` `[FRAMING]` `[QUALITY]`. Creative/Mature also get `[NSFW]`. This is the single biggest quality improvement — output now matches real Danbooru post density (30-50+ tags).
- **Danbooru-density few-shot examples** — all three mode pools replaced with 30-45 tag examples that demonstrate the specificity level expected (e.g. `black_shirt, t-shirt, long_sleeves, miniskirt, pleated_skirt, boots, black_boots, knee_boots, arm_warmers, black_arm_warmers, nail_polish, x_hair_ornament, hair_over_one_eye, twintails, sidelocks, red_background`).
- **Archetype-specific clothing backfill pools** — when the LLM under-delivers, the backfill now pulls from archetype-specific clothing/accessory lists: emo/goth → `black_shirt, arm_warmers, knee_boots, studded_belt`; school → `serafuku, kneehighs, loafers, hair_ribbon`; elf/archer → `bow_(weapon), quiver, cape, leather, gauntlets`; bikini/beach → `barefoot, sand, side-tie_bikini_bottom, tan`.
- **Expanded concept expansion map** — 30+ new entries covering subcultures (`emo`, `goth`, `punk`), relationships (`couple`, `lovers`, `romantic`), outdoor settings (`lake`, `river`, `ocean`, `sea`, `mountain`, `field`, `meadow`, `garden`, `rooftop`, `city`, `street`), weather/time (`rain`, `snow`, `sunset`, `night`, `winter`, `summer`, `spring`, `autumn`), and activities (`swimming`, `swimsuit`, `bikini`, `festival`, `wedding`).
- **Expanded literal tag map** — 25+ new phrase→tag mappings: `bikini`, `swimsuit`, `one-piece`, `school uniform`, `emo`, `goth`, `punk`, and all major settings (`lake`, `river`, `ocean`, `beach`, `forest`, `park`, `bedroom`, `kitchen`, `library`, `classroom`, `rooftop`, `alley`, `cathedral`, `church`).
- **Mature wildcard injection** (`_inject_mature_wildcards`) — on SFW descriptions in Mature mode, injects 2-3 tasteful suggestive tags from scene-aware pools (lake → `wet, wet_hair, bare_shoulders`; forest → `thighs, messy_hair`; bedroom → `bare_shoulders, dim_lighting`; generic → `cleavage, bedroom_eyes, parted_lips`).
- **Expanded universal tag set** — added hair styles (`ponytail, twintails, braid, bangs, messy_hair, wavy_hair`), skin/body details (`thighs, legs, bare_shoulders, collarbone, navel, midriff, cleavage, wet, wet_hair, sweat`), accessories (`choker, necklace, earrings, ring, bracelet, ribbon, piercing`), and atmosphere (`golden_hour, ambient_light, scenery, cinematic_lighting`).

#### Tag Enrichment
- **Tag Enrichment mode** — paste seed tags like `1girl, witch_hat, forest, broom, night` and the AI expands them into a full 30-50 tag set with complementary clothing, atmosphere, lighting, and detail tags.
- Input mode toggle (`📝 From Description` / `🏷️ From Seed Tags`) in the Description Tagger tab.
- Three enrichment few-shot example sets (safe, creative, mature) with Danbooru-density outputs.
- `DescriptionTagWorker` `enrich_mode` flag routes to `tagger.enrich_tags()`.

#### Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive README** — complete rewrite covering all features, Description Tagger deep-dive with example output, mode comparison table, writing tips, full post-processing pipeline explanation, model recommendations with tested benchmarks, project structure, FastAPI docs, and training tips.
- **`start-ui.bat` fallback chain** — fixes silent failure when `.venv` is not at the project root. Now tries: (1) `.venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe`, (2) `pythonw` on PATH, (3) `python` on PATH, (4) clear error message with fix instructions. Works with conda, system Python, and differently-named venvs.

### Changed

#### Description Tagger
- **Mode-specific framing** in system prompt: Safe = "stay literal", Creative = "TURN THE DESCRIPTION INTO A RICH, IMAGE-READY PROMPT — be generous", Mature = "expand like Creative AND add suggestive flair".
- **Target tag counts raised**: Safe 35, Creative 50, Mature 50 (was 18/30/35). `num_predict` budgets raised to 500/700/800 tokens.
- **`min_accept` now checks LLM-produced tags** (before backfill) — prevents sparse LLM output padded by backfill from passing the retry threshold. Retries now actually fire when the model under-delivers.
- **Backfill fill ratio** raised to 80% of target for Creative/Mature (was 75%).
- **Safe mode gate** — all modes now use `min_score >= 1` (universal atmosphere tags pass). Safe mode's SFW guarantee is enforced by a dedicated suggestive-tag blocklist (`cleavage, navel, thighs, bare_shoulders, seductive_smile, bedroom_eyes`, etc.) rather than a stricter gate score.
- **`MAX_TAGS`** raised from 50 to 60.
- Generation temperatures adjusted: Creative 0.75 (was 0.65), Mature 0.90 (was 1.05 — was too high, causing incoherence).
- Enrichment mode temperatures: Mature 0.90 (was 1.05).

### Fixed
- Creative mode was producing the same sparse output as Safe because the system prompt said "Only add tags DIRECTLY implied" and "Limit output to the natural number of tags" — both instructions removed.
- `fox_ears`/`fox_tail` hallucination on unrelated prompts reduced — animal-feature tags now require archetype support in the description.
- NSFW few-shot example (`"a nun giving a blowjob"`) was leaking into the Creative pool for SFW inputs — Creative pool now contains only SFW examples.
- Backfill was satisfying `min_accept` before the LLM had a chance to retry with richer output — fixed by checking raw LLM tag count, not post-backfill count.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Relevance gate** in Description Tagger post-processing. Every tag is scored 0-3 against the user's description; score-0 tags (likely hallucinations) are dropped. Franchise tags like `magic_knight_rayearth`, `library_of_ruina`, `master_sword` no longer leak into unrelated prompts.
- **Concept expansion map** (`_CONCEPT_EXPANSIONS`) — 30+ archetype keywords (nun, witch, knight, maid, catgirl, orc, succubus, kitchen, cathedral, library, ...) map to plausible Danbooru tags, letting the LLM use e.g. `veil` for a nun description without that word being named.
- **NSFW act expansion map** (`_ACT_EXPANSIONS`) — 57 sex-act keywords expand to anatomy/position/reaction tags (e.g. `blowjob` → `fellatio, penis, open_mouth, saliva, kneeling, tongue_out`). Applied only in creative/mature modes; safe mode never sees anatomy.
- **Mutual-exclusion conflict resolver** — keeps only the highest-post_count tag within pose/viewpoint/framing/mouth/time-of-day groups (no more `standing + kneeling + lying` collisions).
- **Repetition-loop detector** in `_parse_tags` — truncates the raw response when the model stutters into `saliva, saliva, saliva, ...` loops.
- **Disambiguator auto-block** — tags shaped `tag_(context)` are dropped unless the parenthetical matches a word in the description.
- **Concept-expansion rescue path** — when the LLM returns nothing usable, synthesize tags from archetype and act expansions so the output is never empty.
- **Per-mode retry acceptance thresholds** — safe accepts ≥3 tags, creative ≥5, mature ≥6. Up to 3 attempts with +0.15 temperature per retry. Best result across attempts is kept.
- Expanded `_extract_literal_tags_from_description` from 15 phrases to 80+ (anatomy, body type, sex acts, participants, fluids, archetypes).

### Changed
- **Qwen3 `/no_think` directive** replaces the old `<think>` prefill. Generation time dropped from ~11s to ~4s per run (65% faster) because the reasoning block no longer consumes the `num_predict` budget.
- Prefill detection now scopes to qwen3 thinking variants only — qwen2.5, qwen3-Instruct-2507, and non-qwen models no longer receive the directive.
- Help dialog model recommendations updated with real tested numbers:
  - Qwen3-14B-Abliterated (default): 9.9 avg tags/run, 4s/run
  - Goonsai Qwen2.5-3B NSFW: 7.3 avg tags/run, 7s/run — listed as tested alternative for quick re-runs
  - huihui_ai/qwen3-abliterated:30b-a3b-q4_K_M marked as "not recommended" (thinking variant returns empty output)
  - Untested alternatives section with pull commands for the Instruct-2507 variant, qwen2.5-14b abliterated, and Cydonia 24B

### Fixed
- Franchise-name collisions were slipping through when tags shared a single token with the description. 2-token tags now require both tokens be supported; 3+ token tags require 75% of tokens supported.
- NSFW descriptions like "Orc forcing elf to give him blowjob" no longer return zero tags — act expansions let anatomy pass the relevance gate in creative/mature modes.

### Added
- **Tag Enrichment** — expand a list of seed tags with complementary Danbooru tags from the LLM. Paste tags like `1girl, beach, volleyball` and the AI returns complementary tags (`towel, lying_on_towel, sunshine, dolphins`) that fit the scene.
- Three enrichment few-shot example sets (safe, creative, mature) with NSFW anatomy handled by the mature mode selector — safe enrichment never returns explicit anatomy.
- "Input Mode" toggle in the Description Tagger tab (`📝 From Description` / `🏷️ From Seed Tags`) switches between classic description-to-tags and the new tag-enrichment pipeline.
- Dynamic UI: the tab title, hint label, placeholder text, and Generate button text update based on the active input mode.
- `DescriptionTagWorker` supports `enrich_mode` flag — routes to `tagger.enrich_tags()` when seed-tag mode is active.

### Changed
- `_generate_tags_from_description` now detects the input mode and passes `enrich_mode` to the worker thread.
- Input group box and hint label promoted to `self.` attributes for runtime switching.

## [v1.3.1] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Model Manager dialog** — pull, list, and delete Ollama models from within the app (Description Tagger tab → ⚙️ Manage Models). No CLI needed.
- **Regex-based blacklist/whitelist** — wrap patterns in `/slashes/` (e.g. `/^bad_/`) in blacklist/whitelist fields for regex matching against tag names via `apply_filters()`.

### Fixed
- **Model Manager UI freeze** — pull and delete operations now run on a `ModelOperationWorker` background thread with an indeterminate progress bar, keeping the dialog responsive during long downloads.

### Changed
- Version bumped to `1.3.1` (window title, About dialog, `app.setApplicationVersion`).

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- Danbooru-tag autocomplete in the caption editor backed by a prefix Trie (O(k) lookup independent of tag count).
- Background QThread CSV loading so the UI stays responsive while the 1M+ tag vocabulary loads.
- Watch-folder with `QFileSystemWatcher` + QTimer debouncing for automatic batch tagging of new images.
- Prompt Tools: Copy as Prompt, Build Negative Prompt, and Tag Frequency Dashboard.
- AI Metadata extraction from PNG info chunks (Stable Diffusion / NovelAI parameters).
- Visual toolbar groups with `QFrame.VLine` sunken dividers (5 logical groups).
- Undo/Redo stack (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) for tag table edits.
- Per-spinbox coloured SVG chevron icons.
- Export caption beside source file option.
- Drop overlay hint ("Drop images here") on drag enter.

### Changed
- Unified all version strings to `v1.3.0` (window title, About dialog, Qt metadata).
- Build artifact renamed from `img-tagger.exe` to `Img-Tagboru.exe`.
- Replaced all ad-hoc `print()` debug output with Python `logging` module (`logger.debug()`/`logger.info()`/`logger.warning()`).
- `requirements.txt`: fixed `uvicorn[standard]` → `uvicorn` (bracket extras syntax is `pip`-specific, not standard).

### Fixed
- Temp SVG accumulation: `styles.py` now writes SVG files once and registers `atexit` cleanup via `shutil.rmtree`.
- Web download security: added `Content-Length` validation (100 MiB cap) to `_download_web_image_to_temp`.
- README startup instructions: `frontend/native_app.py` → `frontend/native/main_window.py`.

### Removed
- Stale migration scripts: `scripts/add_method.py`, `scripts/fix_ui.py`.

## [v1.2.0] — 2025-12-01
